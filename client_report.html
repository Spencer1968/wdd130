                <p>For my website, the process of deciding what content to put on my site was pretty easy.
                    I wanted my site to act as a gallery/portfolio for my own artwork and photography.
                    In choosing what images and content to publish, I went through the images that I have of my art,
                    and I chose the best ones that I am most proud of. Same thing for my photography. In terms of 
                    paragraphs, I really just wanted there to be a description of what my website is for, and I
                    wanted it to have my artist-statement, so I wrote that out and gave it to my lead developer.
                </p>
                <p>In terms of how I was able to communicate with my lead developer, we exchanged both emails and phone numbers.
                    We communicated mostly through our in-person interactions in class, but also through text, as needed.
                    There weren't really any problems with communication between the two of us. We had class regularly, and
                    with my phone number, it made it even easier for him to contact me with questions, and visa versa.
                </p>
                <p>My lead developer did a fantastic job of bringing my idea to life. The team as a whole exceeded my expectation.
                    There were a few times where they misunderstood what I was wanting, but after getting clarification,
                    they adjusted things exactly as I wanted them to be. I am super happy with how the site turned out!
                    The only thing that I can think of, looking at it now, is the responsiveness of the website. It looks
                    great full-screen, but when you try to go smaller, it doesn't look good at all. I was hoping that they would
                    make it work with mobile devices as well, but I'm not too hung up on that. 
                </p>
                <p>Honestly, there isn't much that I would do differently next time I hire a team to do a project for me.
                    I was confident in my team, and I was able to communicate with them what I wanted, and they promptly
                    made those changes. The only thing that I can think of is that they didn't reach out to me as much as
                    I hoped that they would. I was hoping that there would be more "check-ins" or just getting updates from
                    the team, but I didn't hear anything from them unless I asked or they had a question about something.
                    That is really it though. Again, I am super happy with the way that things went, and the final result.

                <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
                <p>As the lead developer for Jace Kelley's website, there was a lot going on. I communicated with both him and my
                    junior developers through text, and that worked out really well. I was able to assign the tasks to my junior devs
                    this way as well. For the most part, we did really well. John did a really good job on his page, and I was super happy
                    with it, as well as the client was happy with it. I was able to mostly manage everything either in class or through text.
                    However, one of my junior developers, Aidan Kemeney, didn't do anything for the project. He barely responded to my messages,
                    so his portion of things didn't get done properly. As for communicating between my whole team and the client, texting worked
                    great. Jace was able to stay updated and tell us if there were things that he wanted us to change, or if there were things 
                    that needed fixed. At this point, everything is done except for the page that was assigned to Aidan. The only thing that isn't
                    quite right is the responsiveness of the page and how it looks in smaller size.
                </p>
                <p>Publishing the site through github was pretty straight forward. It took me a little while to fully understand and figure out
                    how to publish each of the changes I made, but once I figured it out, it was smooth sailing. We shared the link of the website
                    with our client so that they would be able to stay up-to-date on what was happening and what the site looked like. I think that
                    this actually worked out really well because he was able to let us know if there were any major changes that needed to be made in real
                    time instead of having to wait until the very end. Overall though, managing the site was not that difficult, it just took some
                    getting used to. I definitely learned a lot, and it was helpful to see how github works and learn how to manage a website on it.

                <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
                <p>One of my team lead communicated with the rest of us through text. For the one project, things went really well. There were not any
                    major issues in communicating. There wasn't a whole lot of communication other than just deciding who was doing what for the site,
                    but when we have had to sort things out, communication has been super smooth. The expectations were laid out, and I exactly what I
                    was responsible for. The other project though, with Aidan Kemeney as the lead developer, did not go very well. He didn't communicate 
                    anything to us. He barely responded to our texts, and didn't do any work on anything.It was difficult to get things done, but the other 
                    junior developer and I worked together and communicated through text as well. That was okay. With this second project though, the expectations
                    were not laid out at all. I was not told by my lead dev what to work on, how it needed to look, or anything. I just had to figure things
                    out with the other junior developer. 
                </p>
                <p>I was very much so able to get my parts done. I don't know if the styling is exactly how the client wanted because they didn't give us a lot
                    of specifics around that, at least for one of them, but they are done. There is styling, and it does look like it should. I really enjoyed
                    the challenge of figuring out how to make the changes that I wanted. It was a fun project, and I am grateful for the chance to learn in this
                    way. Both of my pages as a junior developer are done, with all of the information that was provided to me. I didn't really run into any issues
                    with GitHub. It was all pretty simple, just took some getting used to. I didn't know what the best way was to go about adding the changes to
                    the project, so I did a lot of small commits instead of just a few really big ones. This made it a little annoying to try to refresh the page
                    to see the changes in effect, but after the initial waiting, it worked out well for me.

                <h2>General Experience and Reflections</h2>
                <p>For me, honestly, the most challenging part of this assignment was doing the styling and trying to get the positioning of the elements the way
                    that I wanted them to be. This took a while to overcome, but eventually, I was able to make it work. I was able to work with my team for some
                    things, and they were able to help me figure out what the problems were with the styling and why it wasn't working. However, there were some things
                    that I was able to either figure out on my own just by trial and error, or I would upload a screenshot into Google Gemini and ask it to explain
                    why the code wasn't working. With the feedback that it gave me, I was able to adjust the styles through trial and error until I finally got the
                    page to look the way that I wanted it to. One of the things that I enjoyed most about this project was just the chance to get some experience with
                    working with clients and a team. I have always loved the idea of web development, and I am thinking about trying to get into a career with web development,
                    so it has been great for me to get a little more experience doing an actual site and not just doing smaller exercises. I have enjoyed working with a team
                    and figuring out how to communicate and work with them back and forth to accomplish the tasks at hand.
                </p>
                <p>If I could do anything differently, it would probably be how I communicate with everyone, and how we lay out expectations. While I tried my best to communicate
                    what was needed, there was a lot that was still left up to each individual person. If I was to do it again, I would make sure to lay out specific expectations
                    for each person and what exactly they need to accomplish. I think I would also lay out and plan specific deadlines to check in and see, as a whole, how the
                    progress is coming along, if anybody is having any issues, and how we can help each other even more. I personally feel that after this project, my confidence
                    in my ability to work on real-world projects has improved, and while I still have a lot to learn and understand better, I am excited for the possibility of
                    working on other projects in the future.
