                <p>For my website, the process of deciding what content to put on my site was pretty easy.
                    I wanted my site to act as a gallery/portfolio for my own artwork and photography.
                    In choosing what images and content to publish, I went through the images that I have of my art,
                    and I chose the best ones that I am most proud of. Same thing for my photography. In terms of 
                    paragraphs, I really just wanted there to be a description of what my website is for, and I
                    wanted it to have my artist-statement, so I wrote that out and gave it to my lead developer.
                </p>
                <p>In terms of how I was able to communicate with my lead developer, we exchanged both emails and phone numbers.
                    We communicated mostly through our in-person interactions in class, but also through text, as needed.
                    There weren't really any problems with communication between the two of us. We had class regularly, and
                    with my phone number, it made it even easier for him to contact me with questions, and visa versa.
                </p>
                <p>My lead developer did a fantastic job of bringing my idea to life. The team as a whole exceeded my expectation.
                    There were a few times where they misunderstood what I was wanting, but after getting clarification,
                    they adjusted things exactly as I wanted them to be. I am super happy with how the site turned out!
                    The only thing that I can think of, looking at it now, is the responsiveness of the website. It looks
                    great full-screen, but when you try to go smaller, it doesn't look good at all. I was hoping that they would
                    make it work with mobile devices as well, but I'm not too hung up on that. 
                </p>
                <p>Honestly, there isn't much that I would do differently next time I hire a team to do a project for me.
                    I was confident in my team, and I was able to communicate with them what I wanted, and they promptly
                    made those changes. The only thing that I can think of is that they didn't reach out to me as much as
                    I hoped that they would. I was hoping that there would be more "check-ins" or just getting updates from
                    the team, but I didn't hear anything from them unless I asked or they had a question about something.
                    That is really it though. Again, I am super happy with the way that things went, and the final result.
